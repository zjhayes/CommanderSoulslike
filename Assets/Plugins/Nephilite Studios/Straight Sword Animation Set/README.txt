Q: 
What is "Legacy" Vs "Nephilim"?

A: 
The legacy animations were the first versions of the animation set. Since we also use these animations in our very own Dark Fantasy action RPG,
overtime we continued to modify/polish them to better fit our vision. In short, the "Nephilim" versions of these animations are remastered versions 
of the original, sometimes replacing the original motion completely. We suggest using those over the original!

Q:
What is the "Core" folder, and why is it outside of the animation set folders?

A:
The "Core" folder are motions that are shared with multiple weapon types, usually locomotion.
